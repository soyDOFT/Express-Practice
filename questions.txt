Node Questions:
1. Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript written in C++ and based on Googleâ€™s v8 engine.
   It is used to run JavaScript outside of a browser and to add more backend functionality.
2. Hands-on practice is crucial for effective learning in Node.js so that you can better remember
   and actually know what Node.js does firsthand.
3. Node.js is based on a single threaded event loop and it handles client requests asynchronously.
4. To install Node.js you must first install a version manager for node, like nvm,
 through the nodejs.org website. Node Package Manager is important because it provides access
 to different packages and modules to use with Node.js.
5. The role of the JSON file in a Node.js project is to keep track of the modules 
   for its settings, for example a list of its dependencies.
6. HTTP modules help build server-side networking applications by enabling access to 
   methods, like .createServer(), that handle HTTP requests and responses.
